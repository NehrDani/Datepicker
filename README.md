## Datepicker plugin in plain javascript - no dependencies

Work in progress...

The core functions work well.
There is still some work to implement it though.
But here are some examples how to implement and use it :

Feel free to try, I appreciate every feedback.

I'm not planning to add any implmenting features into the core.
I want the core slick and lightweight.
I think the Datepicker is much more flexible and expandable without that bloat.
